# AllAboutThreads

This is a simple and quick learning project to understand all about threads and multi-threading in Java

Steps:

1. Clone this project

2. Import it as a Java project in Eclipse

3. Run different main classes as Java applications. Read class level comments to know what that main class does.

NOTE: This application is written with Java 8 and it should work fine with Java 7 as well. But no guarantees!
